===========================================================

What is CSS?
----------------
CSS is the styling language used in html
It is used to add style to the web pages
CSS is used to separate the presentation of a document from its structure,
which is controlled by HTML or XML.

------------------
CSS can be applied in three ways
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

- 1. Inline CSS
        Inline CSS is used to add style to a single element
        It is written inside the element's tag (using style attribute)
        It is not recommended to use inline CSS as it can make the code messy 
        and difficult to maintain.

- 2. Internal CSS
        Internal CSS is used to add style to a single HTML document
        It is written inside the HTML document (inside the head tag using style tag)
        It is not recommended to use internal CSS as it can make 
        the code messy and difficult to maintain.

- 3. External CSS
        External CSS is used to add style to multiple HTML documents
        It is written in a separate file (with .css extension)
        It is linked to the html using <link> tag
        It is recommended to use external CSS as it makes the code clean and easy to
        maintain.

What are css selectors?
-----------------
CSS selectors are used to select the elements in the HTML document 
They are used to apply styles to the selected elements.

There are four types of selectors
1.  Element selectors:
        These are used to select elements based on their element name
        Example: p {color: blue;} selects all the paragraph elements.
2.  Class selectors:
        These are used to select elements based on their class name
        It is denoted using .
        Example: .red {color: red;} selects all the elements with class name red.
3.  ID selectors
        These are used to select elements based on their id name
        It is denoted using #
        Example: #red {color: red;} selects the element with id name red.
4.  Universal selector:
        This is used to select all elements in the document
        It is denoted using *
        Example: * {color: blue;} selects all the elements in the document.

CSS specificity

multiple styles with the same property and value

=> id>class>element>universal

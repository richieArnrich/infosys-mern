JavaScript

    It is a programming language used as a webtechnology
    It is used for web development
    It is used for mobile app development and game development

    JavaScript adds functionality to frontend
    It is used for backend development with Node.js

Variables in JS
    Variables are used to store data
    Variables are case sensitive
    Variables are declared with let, const, var

    Variables using let keyword
        let name = "Manoj";

        1. Variables using let keyword, values can be reassigned
            let name = "Manoj";
            name = "Rahul";
        2. Variables using let keyword cannot be redeclared
        let name = "Manoj";
        let name = "Rahul"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been created
    
    Variables using const keyword
        const name = "Manoj";
        1. Variables using const keyword, values cannot be reassigned
        const name = "Manoj";
        name = "Rahul"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
        2. Variables using const keyword can be redeclared
        const name = "Manoj";
        const name = "Rahul"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been created

    Variables using var keyword
        var name = "Manoj";
        1. Variables using var keyword, values can be reassigned
        var name = "Manoj";
        name = "Rahul";
        2. Variables using var keyword can be redeclared
        var name = "Manoj";
        var name = "Rahul"; // No error

Operators in js
    Question 1 : Given a number which when divided by 7 leaves a remainder 3 and produces
    a quotient of 8. What is the number?
    Answer: 59

    Question 2: 
    let n1 = 5
    let n2 = 7
    let r = n1++ + n2-- + 11 + n1
    clg(r)

    Preincrement Operators
        The preincrement operator increments the value of a variable before it is used in an expression.

        Working of preincrement:
        1. The value of the variable is incremented by 1.
        2. The incremented value is assigned to another variable.
        3. Access the updated value.

    Postincrement Operator
        The postincrement operator increments the value of a variable after it is used in an expression.

        Working of postincrement
        1. The current value of the variable is assigned to another variable.
        2. The value of the variable is incremented by 1.
        3. Access the updated value.

Control Flow in JS
    Control flow statements are used to control the flow of program
    1. Conditional Statements
    2. Looping statements

    Conditional Statements: 
    They execute a set of statements only when a given condition happens to be true
    1. If statement
        Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        }
        if(10>5){
            console.log("10 is greater than 5");
        }
    2. if-else statement
        Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        }else{
            // code to be executed if condition is false
        }
        if(10>5){
            console.log("10 is greater than 5");
        }else{
            console.log("10 is not greater than 5");
        }

    3. If-else-if ladder
        Syntax:
        if (condition1) {
            // code to be executed if condition1 is true
        }else if(condition 2){
            // code to be executed if condition2 is trues
        }else{
            // code to be executed if all conditions are false
        }

    4. Switch case
        Syntax:
        switch(expression){
            case value1:{
                // code to be executed if expression equals value1
            }break;
            case value2:{
                // code to be executed if expression equals value2
            }break;
            default:{
                // code to be executed if expression does not match any case value
            }
        }

    Looping Statements
    They execute a set of statements repeatedly for a specified number of times or until 
    a given condition is becomes false.
    Types of loops:
    1. while loop
    2. do while loop
    3. for loop
    ---- dealt later --------
    4. for in loop (objects)
    5. for of loop (arrays)
    6. for each loop (arrays)
    -------------------------

    Any loop will have three segments:
    1. Initialization
    2. Condition
    3. Increment/Decrement

    while loop
        Syntax:
            Initialization
            while (condition) {
                // code to be executed
                update (increment/cecrement)
            }
        Working of while loop
        1. Initialization
        2. Condition is checked
        3. If condition is true, code inside the loop is executed
        4. update is executed
        5. Condition is checked again and repeat 3 and 4 until condition becomes false
        Example:
        int i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            console.log("Hello");
            i++;
        }

        Practice programs:
        Write a loop to find the multiple of 5 multiplied 8 times without using * or / or %
        Write a loop to find the sum of first 10 natural numbers
        Write a loop to find the sum of all digits from a given number
        number = 1998;
        sum of all digits: 1+9+9+8
        sum = 27
        Write a loop to find power of a number

    do-while loop
        Syntax:
            Initialization
            do {
                // do-while block code
                update (increment/decrement)
            }while(condition);
        
        Working:
            1. Initialization
            2. do-while block code is executed
            3. update is executed
            4. condition is checked
            5. repeat 2, 3 and 4 until condition becomes false

    for loop
        Syntax:
        for (initialization; condition; update) {
            // code to be executed
        }

        Working:
        1. initialization
        2. condition is checked
        3. if condition is true, code inside the loop is executed
        4. update is executed
        5. condition is checked again and repeat 2, 3 and 4 until condition becomes false

BOM and DOM in JavaScript
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOM (Browser Object Model)
BOM is a set of objects and methods that are available in the browser window object. 
It provides a way to interact with the browser and its features. 
BOM is used to perform tasks such as opening new windows, setting the title of the page, 
and getting the current URL.

--------------------------------------
DOM (Document Object Model)
--------------------------------------
DOM is a set of objects and methods that are used to interact with the HTML document.
It provides a way to access and manipulate the HTML elements in the document.
DOM is used to perform tasks such as getting the value of an input field, changing the text of
a paragraph, and adding new elements to the document.
------------------------------------------------------
Asynchronous JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------
Asynchronous JavaScript is a type of JavaScript that allows you to perform tasks in the background.
Parallel execution of two or more functions
It allows you to execute code without blocking the execution of other code.
It is used to perform tasks such as making API calls, loading images, and handling user input.

----------------------------------------------------------
Callback Functions
----------------------------------------------------------
Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions.
They are used to perform tasks such as handling errors, making API calls, and executing code after a
delay.

Nested callbacks lead to callback Hell
----------------------------------------------------------
Callback Hell is a situation where you have multiple nested callbacks.
It can make your code difficult to read and understand.
----------------------------------------------------------

Promises In JavaScript
----------------------------------------------------------
Promises are a way to handle asynchronous code in a more readable and maintainable way.
They are used to perform tasks such as making API calls, loading images, and handling user input.
A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
result.

----------------------------------------------------------
Async/Await
----------------------------------------------------------
Async/Await is a way to write asynchronous code that looks and feels like synchronous code.
It is used to perform tasks such as making API calls, loading images, and handling user input.
Async: 
It is used to declare a function that can be executed asynchronously.
It makes a function return a promise object by default
Await:
It is used to pause the execution of a function until a promise is resolved or rejected.
It is used to get the result of a promise.
Await is only used in an async function

JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a representation of JS object in a string format
It is used to exchange data between a server and a web application
To convert object to JSON use JSON.stringify(obj)
To convert JSON to object use JSON.parse(json)

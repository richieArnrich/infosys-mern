JavaScript

    It is a programming language used as a webtechnology
    It is used for web development
    It is used for mobile app development and game development

    JavaScript adds functionality to frontend
    It is used for backend development with Node.js

Variables in JS
    Variables are used to store data
    Variables are case sensitive
    Variables are declared with let, const, var

    Variables using let keyword
        let name = "Manoj";

        1. Variables using let keyword, values can be reassigned
            let name = "Manoj";
            name = "Rahul";
        2. Variables using let keyword cannot be redeclared
        let name = "Manoj";
        let name = "Rahul"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been created
    
    Variables using const keyword
        const name = "Manoj";
        1. Variables using const keyword, values cannot be reassigned
        const name = "Manoj";
        name = "Rahul"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
        2. Variables using const keyword can be redeclared
        const name = "Manoj";
        const name = "Rahul"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been created

    Variables using var keyword
        var name = "Manoj";
        1. Variables using var keyword, values can be reassigned
        var name = "Manoj";
        name = "Rahul";
        2. Variables using var keyword can be redeclared
        var name = "Manoj";
        var name = "Rahul"; // No error

Operators in js
    Question 1 : Given a number which when divided by 7 leaves a remainder 3 and produces
    a quotient of 8. What is the number?
    Answer: 59

    Question 2: 
    let n1 = 5
    let n2 = 7
    let r = n1++ + n2-- + 11 + n1
    clg(r)

    Preincrement Operators
        The preincrement operator increments the value of a variable before it is used in an expression.

        Working of preincrement:
        1. The value of the variable is incremented by 1.
        2. The incremented value is assigned to another variable.
        3. Access the updated value.

    Postincrement Operator
        The postincrement operator increments the value of a variable after it is used in an expression.

        Working of postincrement
        1. The current value of the variable is assigned to another variable.
        2. The value of the variable is incremented by 1.
        3. Access the updated value.

Control Flow in JS
    Control flow statements are used to control the flow of program
    1. Conditional Statements
    2. Looping statements

    Conditional Statements: 
    They execute a set of statements only when a given condition happens to be true
    1. If statement
        Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        }
        if(10>5){
            console.log("10 is greater than 5");
        }
    2. if-else statement
        Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        }else{
            // code to be executed if condition is false
        }
        if(10>5){
            console.log("10 is greater than 5");
        }else{
            console.log("10 is not greater than 5");
        }

    3. If-else-if ladder
        Syntax:
        if (condition1) {
            // code to be executed if condition1 is true
        }else if(condition 2){
            // code to be executed if condition2 is trues
        }else{
            // code to be executed if all conditions are false
        }

    4. Switch case
        Syntax:
        switch(expression){
            case value1:{
                // code to be executed if expression equals value1
            }break;
            case value2:{
                // code to be executed if expression equals value2
            }break;
            default:{
                // code to be executed if expression does not match any case value
            }
        }

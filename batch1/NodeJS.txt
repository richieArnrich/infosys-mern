Nodejs provides JS runtime environment to execute server side scripting
- Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- Node.js is event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
- Node.js supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and CoffeeScript
- Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages and modules available through the npm package manager

Modules in Nodejs
-------------------
- Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple applications
- Modules can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or other languages
- Modules can be installed using npm or yarn package managers
- Modules can be required(imported) in other modules using the `require()` function

Types of modules in Nodejs
---------------------------
- Built-in modules: These are modules that come pre-installed with Node.js, such as `http module`
- Third-party modules: These are modules that are not part of the Node.js core, but can be installed
using npm
- Custom modules: These are modules that are created by developers to solve specific problems

Nodejs provides JS runtime environment to execute server side scripting
- Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- Node.js is event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
- Node.js supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and CoffeeScript
- Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages and modules available through the npm package manager

Modules in Nodejs
-------------------
- Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple applications
- Modules can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or other languages
- Modules can be installed using npm or yarn package managers
- Modules can be required(imported) in other modules using the `require()` function

Types of modules in Nodejs
---------------------------
- Built-in modules: These are modules that come pre-installed with Node.js, such as `http module`
- Third-party modules: These are modules that are not part of the Node.js core, but can be installed
using npm
- Custom modules: These are modules that are created by developers to solve specific problems

HTTP module in Nodejs
-------------------
- The HTTP module in Node.js allows developers to create web servers and handle HTTP requests

What is a webserver?
-------------------
- A web server is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients and sends back HTTP responses
- Web servers can be used to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and images,
or to run server-side scripts, such as Node.js applications

File Module in Nodejs
-------------------
- The File module in Node.js allows developers to interact with the file system
- It provides methods to read and write files, create directories, and delete files
- It also provides methods to check if a file exists, get file stats, and more


------------------------------------
API
------------------------------------
- API stands for Application Programming Interface
- API is a set of defined rules that enables different applications to communicate with each other
- API can be used to interact with external services, such as databases, file systems, and web servers
- API can be used to create web services, such as RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, and
WebSockets, SOAP APIs

Component in ReactJS
A React component is a small, reusable piece of code that represents a UI element. It can be
a function, a class. Components can be nested inside each other to create
complex UI structures.

Functional Component:
A functional component is a simple function that returns JSX elements. It does not have 
its own state or lifecycle methods
To handle data it makes of props

Any component once created has to be called in App.JS
The component which calls the other component is called as Parent Component
The component which is called by the Parent Component is called as Child Component

Component Nesting:
Components can be nested inside each other to create complex UI structures.
Data can be passed from the top-most component to the lower-most component using props
This process is called as Props Drilling
Which leads to unwanted complication in the code
To overcome this complication we use a function called useContext()

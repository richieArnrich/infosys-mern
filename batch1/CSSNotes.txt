CSS : cascading style sheets
CSS is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance 
of web pages written in HTML or XML
CSS provides properties to control the appearence of the webpage
CSS is used to separate the presentation of a document from its structure, 
which is controlled by HTML or  XML
CSS is applied in three ways:
1. Inline CSS: CSS is written directly in the HTML document,using the 
    style attribute within the elements
2. Internal CSS: CSS is written in the HTML document, but in a separate section,
    using <style> tag
3. External CSS: CSS is written in a separte .css file and linked to html using <link> tag

Internal CSS and External CSS needs CSS selectors
CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to select the elements in the HTML document to apply the styles
CSS selectors can be based on various attributes of the HTML elements, 
such as id, class, tag name, universal
CSS Selectors Types
1. Universal Selector: Selects all elements in the document
2. Class Selector: Selects elements with a specific class
3. ID Selector: Selects an element with a specific id
4. Tag Selector: Selects elements with a specific tag name

The CSS box model is a concept that describes the structure of an 
HTML element in terms of its content, padding,border and margin

The box model consists of four main parts: content, padding, border, and margin
The content is the actual content of the element, the padding is the space between the content and the
border, the border is the visible border around the element, and the margin is the space between the
element and other elements.

CSS Positions
CSS positions are used to control the position of an element on the screen.
There are 5 Types
1. Static Position: The default position of an element, 
it is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
Offset properties are not activated
2. Relative Position: The element is positioned relative to its normal position, and offset
properties like top,right,bottom,left are activated.
3. Absolute Position: The element is taken off from the normal flow of the document
and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Offset properties are activated.
4. Fixed Position: The element is taken off from the normal flow of the document and positioned
relative to the viewport (fixed at a point). Offset properties are activated.
5. Sticky Position: It behaves as a relative element until a given threshold point post which it
behaves as a fixed element.

CSS Animation
CSS animations are used to create animations on a webpage.
There are two types of animations: keyframe animations and animation properties.
Keyframe animations are used to create animations by specifying keyframes, 
which are points in time where the animation changes.

delay, and iteration count.
